# budgeter

Angular frontend · FastAPI backend · PostgreSQL in Docker · AWS CDK infrastructure.

One repo, one clone, one `docker compose up`. Nothing installs itself into your
laptop's boot sequence.

## Layout

```
frontend/   Angular 20 (npm)
backend/    FastAPI, Python 3.12 (uv)
infra/      AWS CDK, Python 3.12 (uv)
docker-compose.yml   postgres:17 — runs only when you start it
```

## Prerequisites

Already installed on this machine: `node` (nvm 22.18), `uv`, `psql` (libpq),
`aws`, `cdk`, `gh`, Docker Desktop.

## Running it

**Database** — start first, stop when you're done for the day:

```sh
docker compose up -d db      # start
docker compose down          # stop (data persists in the volume)
docker compose down -v       # stop AND erase all data
```

**Backend** — http://localhost:8000, API under `/api`, docs at `/docs`:

```sh
cd backend
uv run uvicorn backend.main:app --reload
```

**Frontend** — http://localhost:4200:

```sh
cd frontend
npm start
```

**Verify the whole chain** with the DB running:

```sh
curl localhost:8000/api/health/db      # {"database":"ok"}
```

## Migrations

Alembic owns the schema. Never `create_all()` — it only ever creates, so the
first column you add puts your laptop and every other database out of sync.

```sh
cd backend
uv run alembic revision --autogenerate -m "create transactions"   # write it
uv run alembic upgrade head                                       # apply it
uv run alembic downgrade -1                                       # undo one
uv run alembic current                                            # where am I
uv run alembic check                                              # models vs db
```

The database must be running for any of these — autogenerate diffs your models
against the live schema.

- **Models must be imported by `backend/src/backend/models.py`.** Autogenerate
  only sees what's registered on `Base.metadata`; a model that module never
  imports looks like a table it should *drop*.
- **Read every generated migration before applying it.** Autogenerate handles
  added and dropped tables and columns well. It cannot see a rename — it emits
  a drop plus an add, which throws the data away. Rewrite those as
  `op.alter_column(..., new_column_name=...)` by hand.
- The connection string comes from `backend.config.settings`, not `alembic.ini`,
  so `.env` applies here exactly as it does to the app.

## Database access

```sh
psql postgresql://budgeter:budgeter_dev@localhost:5432/budgeter
```

Credentials live in `docker-compose.yml` and are local-dev only. Real
credentials belong in `.env` (gitignored) or AWS Secrets Manager — never in
a committed file, and never on the Desktop.

## Infrastructure

```sh
cd infra
uv run cdk synth        # render CloudFormation
uv run cdk diff         # compare against deployed
uv run cdk deploy       # push to AWS
uv run pytest           # stack assertions
```

The stack is currently environment-agnostic — `env=` is commented out in
`app.py`. Uncomment it before using anything that needs a context lookup
(VPCs, hosted zones, real AZ enumeration).

## Conventions

- Postgres runs in Docker, never as a native install.
- Python is pinned per-project via `.python-version` (3.12), not system Python.
- `uv` manages both `backend/` and `infra/` — `uv add <pkg>` updates
  `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock`. No `requirements.txt` anywhere.
- One `.gitignore`, at the repo root.
- Everything the API serves lives under `/api`.
- **Keep this repo out of iCloud** (`~/Documents`, `~/Desktop`). iCloud sets the
  macOS `UF_HIDDEN` flag on files it manages, and CPython's `site.addpackage()`
  silently skips hidden `.pth` files. That kills the editable install and you get
  `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'backend'` with nothing in the traceback
  pointing at the cause. Diagnose with `ls -lO .venv/lib/python3.12/site-packages/*.pth`
  — a `hidden` flag in that column is the tell. It lives in `~/Coding` for this reason.
